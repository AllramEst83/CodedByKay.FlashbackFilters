# Flashback Filters

## Introduction
Welcome to the Flashback Filters project! This initiative aims to recreate the nostalgic aesthetic of family photos from the 1980s and 1990s through digital filters. Our goal is to encapsulate that unique visual feel that many of us remember fondly from our old photo albums.

Currently, the project is in its early stages, being developed as a console application. The long-term vision is to evolve this into either a mobile app or a web-based platform, providing easy access to retro-style filters for everyone.

## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Initial Development  
The project is currently being developed as a console application. This phase focuses on building the core functionality of the 80s and 90s image filters.

**Next Steps:**
- Enhance the console application with more complex filter algorithms.
- Begin transitioning the console logic to a web or mobile-based interface.
- Design a user-friendly UI that captures the retro theme.
